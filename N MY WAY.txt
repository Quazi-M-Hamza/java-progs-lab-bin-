                                            ON MY WAY
I'M SORRY BUT....
DON'T WANNA TALK..
I NEED A MOMENT BEFORE I GO,
IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL...
AND YOU'RE THE BLAME ''
YOU DON'T NEED TO SEE ME CRY
CUZ EVEN IF THEY UNDERSTAND ...
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND........

SO WHEN I'M THERE FINISHED,
MORE BOUT MY BUSINESSS...
I'M READY TO SAVE THE WORLD...

I'M TAKING MY MISERY,
ACHING MY B**** CAN'T BE...
EVERYONE'S FAVOURITE GAL....
