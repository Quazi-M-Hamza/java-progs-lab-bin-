	              			Ignite
					
Fireflies
A miilion little pieces
Burning on my skin 
It turns me on again 

You and I 
Survivors of the same kind
You're the only one
Dancing on the sun

Let the darkness lead us into the light 
Let our dreams get lost feel the temperature rise
Baby tell me one more beautiful lie 
One touch and I ignite

Let the starship speeding into the light
You amd I get lost in the infinity lights
Baby tell me one more beautiful lie
One touch and I ignite
 
All the heat as we coolide
Like a fever that feels so right 
So baby tell me one more beautiful liec 
One touch amd I ignite
